# Nicholson Gothic

Nicholson Gothic began as a project for school where I envisioned a typeface for a local park's signage. An early version was even painted on a wooden sign. This weight and version of Nicholson Gothic is available as an open typeface. 

* Basic latin, numbers, and symbols
* Covers most Western European languages
